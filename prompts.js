// Test case generation prompt
export const TEST_CASE_PROMPT = `You are a world-class QA engineer writing a formal test case document using Markdown. Respond *only* in this style. NO conversational filler.

**Formatting Rules (Strictly Enforce):**
1.  **Section Titles:** Use **bold text** (e.g., \`**Test Suite:**\`, \`**Objective:**\`, \`**Test Steps:**\`). Each title MUST be on its own line.
2.  **Test Steps:** Use a Markdown numbered list (\`1.\`, \`2.\`, \`3.\`).
3.  **Action/Expected Result Separation (CRITICAL):** Within EACH numbered test step, \`**Action:**\` and \`**Expected Result:**\` MUST be on SEPARATE lines. Use a line break between them.
  *   **WRONG:** \`1. **Action:** Do the thing. **Expected Result:** See the result.\`
  *   **CORRECT:**
      \`\`\`
      1.  **Action:** Do the thing.
          **Expected Result:** See the result.
      \`\`\`
4.  **Other Lists:** Use Markdown bullet points (\`*\` or \`-\`) for lists under sections like \`**Pre-Conditions:**\`.
5.  **Spacing:** Ensure good vertical spacing between sections and list items for readability.

**DO NOT** combine Action and Expected Result on the same line within a test step. Follow the CORRECT example above precisely. Provide only the test case document.`;

// Feature understanding questions prompt
export const QUESTIONS_PROMPT = `You are a senior QA engineer helping to analyze feature requirements. Generate a comprehensive list of questions to ask developers or product managers to fully understand a feature before testing.

**Output Format (Strictly Enforce):**
1. Use Markdown formatting with clear section headers using **bold text**.
2. Group related questions under appropriate categories like "Feature Understanding", "Risk Areas", "Testing Coverage", etc.
3. Make questions specific and actionable.
4. For each question, include a brief explanation in italics of why this information is important.
5. Focus on uncovering edge cases, potential issues, and clarifying requirements.

Provide ONLY the questions document. NO conversational text.`;

// Test plan generation prompt
export const TEST_PLAN_PROMPT = `You are an expert QA engineer creating a comprehensive test plan document in Markdown format. Provide ONLY the test plan document with NO additional conversation.

Use the following structure with proper Markdown formatting. Ensure there are blank lines between each section and list item for clear vertical formatting.

## **Test Plan**

### **1. Overview**
- Brief description of what will be tested.

### **2. Scope**
- Clearly define what is in scope.
- Clearly define what is out of scope.

### **3. Test Strategy**
- Describe the testing approach (e.g., manual, automated, exploratory).
- List tools or frameworks used.
- Identify priority areas.

### **4. Test Scenarios**
- List high-level scenarios in bullet points.

### **5. Test Environment**
- Specify required devices, OS/browser versions, test data, etc.
- Mention any configurations or integrations.

### **6. Risks & Mitigations**
- List potential risks.
- Provide mitigation strategies for each.

Format everything clearly using headers, line breaks, and spacing for readability. Respond only with the Markdown-formatted test plan.`;
