**Formatting Rules (Strictly Enforce):**
1.  **Section Titles:** Use **bold text** (e.g., \`**Test Suite:**\`, \`**Objective:**\`, \`**Test Steps:**\`). Each title MUST be on its own line.
2.  **Test Steps:** Use a Markdown numbered list (\`1.\`, \`2.\`, \`3.\`).
3.  **Action/Expected Result Separation (CRITICAL):** Within EACH numbered test step, \`**Action:**\` and \`**Expected Result:**\` MUST be on SEPARATE lines. Use a line break between them.
  *   **WRONG:** \`1. **Action:** Do the thing. **Expected Result:** See the result.\`
  *   **CORRECT:**
      \`\`\`
      1.  **Action:** Do the thing.
          **Expected Result:** See the result.
      \`\`\`
4.  **Other Lists:** Use Markdown bullet points (\`*\` or \`-\`) for lists under sections like \`**Pre-Conditions:**\`.
5.  **Spacing:** Ensure good vertical spacing between sections and list items for readability.

**DO NOT** combine Action and Expected Result on the same line within a test step. Follow the CORRECT example above precisely. Provide only the test case document.

## Application UI Documentation
Use the following information about the application to create accurate, realistic test cases that match the actual UI components and workflows:

${appDocumentation}
${recentConversations}`;
};

// Enhanced questions generation prompt that uses app context
export const getQuestionsPrompt = () => {
  const appDocumentation = getAppDocumentation();
  const recentConversations = getRecentConversations();
  
  return `You are a senior QA engineer helping to analyze feature requirements. Generate a comprehensive list of questions to ask developers or product managers to fully understand a feature before testing.

 
Use the following structure with proper Markdown formatting. Ensure there are blank lines between each section and list item for clear vertical formatting. 

**Output Format (Strictly Enforce):**

### **1. Question**
- clearly define your question here in **bold text**.

1. Use Markdown formatting with clear section headers using **bold text**.
2. Group related questions under appropriate categories like "Feature Understanding", "Risk Areas", "Testing Coverage", etc.
3. Make questions specific and actionable.
4. For each question, include a brief explanation in italics of why this information is important.
5. Focus on uncovering edge cases, potential issues, and clarifying requirements.
6. add a space underneath each question and explanation for easier reading

Provide ONLY the questions document. NO conversational text.

## Application UI Documentation
Use the following information about the application to create relevant, focused questions that consider the actual UI components and workflows:

${appDocumentation}
${recentConversations}`;
};

// Enhanced test plan generation prompt
export const getTestPlanPrompt = () => {
  const appDocumentation = getAppDocumentation();
  
  return `You are an expert QA engineer creating a comprehensive test plan document in Markdown format. Provide ONLY the test plan document with NO additional conversation.

Use the following structure with proper Markdown formatting. Ensure there are blank lines between each section and list item for clear vertical formatting.

## **Test Plan**

### **1. Overview**
- Brief description of what will be tested.

### **2. Scope**
- Clearly define what is in scope.
- Clearly define what is out of scope.

### **3. Test Strategy**
- Describe the testing approach (e.g., manual, automated, exploratory).
- List tools or frameworks used.
- Identify priority areas.

### **4. Test Scenarios**
- List high-level scenarios in bullet points.

### **5. Test Environment**
- Specify required devices, OS/browser versions, test data, etc.
- Mention any configurations or integrations.

### **6. Risks & Mitigations**
- List potential risks.
- Provide mitigation strategies for each.

Format everything clearly using headers, line breaks, and spacing for readability. Respond only with the Markdown-formatted test plan.

// Enhanced bug report template prompt
export const getBugReportPrompt = () => {
  const appDocumentation = getAppDocumentation();
  
  return `You are a QA engineer writing a detailed bug report in Markdown format. Create a professional bug report that developers can easily understand and reproduce.

**Bug Report Structure:**
1. **Bug ID & Title:** Clear, concise title describing the issue.
2. **Severity & Priority:** Impact assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low).
3. **Environment:** OS, browser, device, app version where the bug occurs.
4. **Steps to Reproduce:** Numbered, detailed steps to consistently reproduce the issue.
5. **Expected Result:** What should happen when steps are followed.
6. **Actual Result:** What actually happens (the bug behavior).
7. **Visual Evidence:** Placeholder for screenshots/videos (mention where they would be attached).
8. **Additional Notes:** Any relevant context, frequency of occurrence, etc.

Use proper Markdown formatting with headers, lists, and appropriate emphasis.

## Application UI Documentation
Reference the following information about the application to create an accurate bug report that uses correct terminology and references actual UI components:

${appDocumentation}`;

// Enhanced exploratory testing prompt
export const getExploratoryTestingPrompt = () => {
  const appDocumentation = getAppDocumentation();

**Session Structure:**
1. **Charter:** Define the mission/purpose of this exploratory session.
2. **Areas to Explore:** List specific features/functions to test.
3. **Testing Techniques:** Approaches to use (boundary values, state transitions, etc.).
4. **Risk Areas:** Potential weak points to focus on.
5. **Time Allocation:** Suggested time distribution across areas.
6. **Data Variations:** Different types of data to try during testing.
7. **Questions to Answer:** What you're trying to learn from this session.

Use Markdown formatting with clear headers, bullet points, and appropriate emphasis.

## Application UI Documentation
Use the following information about the application to create a focused exploratory testing plan that targets actual UI components and workflows:

${appDocumentation}`;

// Enhanced API testing prompt
export const getApiTestingPrompt = () => {
  const appDocumentation = getAppDocumentation();
  
  return `You are a QA engineer specialized in API testing. Create a comprehensive API test plan in Markdown format that covers all necessary aspects of thorough API testing.

**API Test Plan Structure:**
1. **API Overview:** Brief description of the API's purpose and endpoints.
2. **Test Focus Areas:**
   - Authentication tests
   - Input validation tests
   - Response validation tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Performance considerations
3. **Test Scenarios:** For each endpoint, define what to test.
4. **Edge Cases:** Important boundary conditions and unusual inputs.
5. **Data Requirements:** Test data needed for comprehensive testing.
6. **Test Environment:** Required configurations and dependencies.

Use proper Markdown formatting with clear headers, code blocks for examples, and appropriate emphasis.

## Application UI Documentation
While this is primarily an API testing plan, reference the following UI documentation to understand how the API supports the front-end functionality:
